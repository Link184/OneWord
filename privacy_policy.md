Privacy Policy for OneWord

Effective Date: 23.02.2026

OneWord ("we", "our", or "us") built the OneWord app to provide users with a simple way to learn a new word each day by showing a persistent notification and in-app content. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our Android application (the “App”).

By using the App, you consent to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

1. Information We Do Not Collect

We do not collect personal information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email address, phone number, or device identifiers) through the App. We do not link any data to your identity or share it with third parties for marketing purposes.

Unless you explicitly enter information (such as in a feedback form), we do not access or store personal user content.

2. Automatic Data Collection

The App itself does not send or store personal data on servers. If your device collects any diagnostic information (e.g., crash reports or notifications delivery status), that data may be collected by your device platform only for the purposes of improving performance — but this data is not tied to your identity by us.

3. Use of Cookies and Tracking

We do not use cookies, tracking pixels, or similar technologies within the App. We do not track your behavior across apps or websites, nor do we build usage profiles.

4. Third-Party Services

The OneWord App does not integrate with any third-party SDKs, analytics, advertising, or data collection services. If any third-party libraries are introduced in future versions that collect personal or device data, we will disclose that information here and request any permissions required by Android.

5. Permissions

The App may request permissions necessary for the core functionality you choose to enable (e.g., the ability to show notifications). We do not request access to contacts, location, camera, microphone, storage, or other sensitive device data.

If your app uses notification channels or background services, any related permissions are only to support the basic feature of delivering daily word notifications.

6. Children’s Privacy

OneWord is intended for general audiences. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that a child has provided personal data, we will take steps to delete such information.

7. Security

We strive to use reasonable industry-standard measures to protect information and devices from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.

8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When changes are made, we will revise the “Effective Date” at the top. Significant changes will be communicated in the App or via our repository’s documentation.

Notes for Publishing

Include this privacy policy link in your Google Play Store privacy policy field and within the App (e.g., in a settings or about screen).

If your app later adds analytics, purchases, ads, or any personal data collection, update this policy to specifically list what is collected, why, how it is stored, and with whom it is shared.
